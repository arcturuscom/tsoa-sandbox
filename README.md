# TSOA-Sandbox
A personal project utilizing TSOA with Node, Express and MongoDB for the Server; Angular 5 for the Client.

# Progress
* (Latest) Initialized Angular 5 Frontend. I also tried to include **Angular's Service Worker** in this project. Let's see how far we can go. **Swagger-Codegen** is also working as expected. Good day!!
* (Jan 10 2018) Finally got **Passport** integrated successfully. My routes can be protected with just one line of code (`@Security('JWT')`). Going to implement the rest of `TaskController` then move on to `Frontend`.
* (Jan 10 2018) I've made some changes to `UserController` and finally got **SwaggerUI** integrated and working. The models are rendered fine. Next is to implement another `actor` into the application then move on to `front-end`.
* (Jan 09 2018) What a rough day! I've been looking for a working **AutoMapper** for JS/TS but to no-avail. I've looked at **Automapper-ts** but the author explicitly said he didn't build the package for using Node specifically. I am going to rewrite my `UserController` tomorrow. 
* (Jan 08 2018) I've completed utilizing Repository Pattern for the controllers and successfully generated the `routes.ts` file for the backend. Next, I'm looking into injecting **SwaggerUI** into the project. TSOA, so far, has been working wonder for me. One of the roadblocks was I want to use 3rd party package like `passportJS` to have protected route. However, the `routes` are generated by TSOA. Hence, I had to create a `custom-template` that will inject `passport.authenticate` middleware into the `routes.ts` template. I haven't tested the result but will definitely have it tested in the next commit.
* (Jan 06 2018) I was fascinated by the *almighty* **Swagger** (aka **OpenAPI**) and was really excited to discover `TSOA` package. As I am trying to integrate **TypeScript** with **Node Express** backend, I decide to start on a project with `TSOA`. A lot of roadblocks at first but eventually, I found solutions for most of them.
