# tsoa-sandbox
A personal project utilizing TSOA with Node, Express and MongoDB.

# Progress
* (Today) I've completed utilizing Repository Pattern for the controllers and successfully generated the `routes.ts` file for the backend. Next, I'm looking into injecting **SwaggerUI** into the project. TSOA, so far, has been working wonder for me. One of the roadblocks was I want to use 3rd party package like `passportJS` to have protected route. However, the `routes` are generated by TSOA. Hence, I had to create a `custom-template` that will inject `passport.authenticate` middleware into the `routes.ts` template. I haven't tested the result but will definitely have it tested in the next commit.
* (Jan 06 2018) I was fascinated by the *almighty* **Swagger** (aka **OpenAPI**) and was really excited to discover `TSOA` package. As I am trying to integrate **TypeScript** with **Node Express** backend, I decide to start on a project with `TSOA`. A lot of roadblocks at first but eventually, I found solutions for most of them.
